### Getting Enough Right Data
---
- Understand the danger of making inference about the whole population from a small sample. 
- Pay attention to the **Law of Small Numbers**.
- Statistical Bias Types:
  - Selection bias
  - Self-selection bias
  - Recall bias
  - Observer bias
  - Survivorship bias
  - Omitted variable bias
  - Cause-effect bias
  - Cognitive bias
- Data Cleaning means using the right tools and methods to deal with the raw data after understanding the data source. 
- Ten rules for data cleaning:
  - For every result, keep track of how it was produced
  - Avoid manual data manipulation steps
  - Archive the exact versions of all external programs used
  - Version control all custom scripts
  - Record all intermediate results, when possible in standardized formats
  - For analyses that include randomness, note underlying random seeds
  - Always store raw data behind plots
  - Generate hierarchical analysis output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected
  - Connect textual statements to underlying results
  - Provide public access to scripts, runs, and results
